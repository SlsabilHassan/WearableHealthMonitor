# WearableHealthMonitor
# Description:
This repository is dedicated to the official program developed by Alexandria STEM School, which focuses on creating a wearable health monitoring device specifically for individuals with Down syndrome. With an accessible prototype and user-friendly interface, this program aims to assist both patients and their families.

# Key Features:
- **Real-Time Health Tracking:** Specifically designed for individuals with Down syndrome to monitor health metrics continuously.
- **Integrated Heart Sensor:** Measures heart rate and blood oxygen levels, providing essential health data.
- **Sound Sensor:** Monitors ambient noise levels and alerts parents if they exceed a certain threshold, helping to prevent panic in individuals with Down syndrome.
- **Future Gyroscope Sensor:** Planned integration of a gyroscope sensor to detect accidents and falls.
- **Direct Record Transfer:** Health records are sent directly to both parents and the patient's doctor for timely updates.
- **Emergency Alerts:** Immediate notifications are sent to parents and healthcare providers if health metrics fall outside normal ranges.
- **Decline Monitoring:** The device tracks health declines, alerting caregivers if a deterioration in condition is detected, indicating potential health risks.

# Technologies Used:
- **ESP32 with Wi-Fi Module:** Provides seamless connectivity between sensors and the monitoring system.
- **Programming Languages:** Python, C++, and JavaScript for implementing various functionalities.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Employed for predictive health analytics and pattern recognition.
- **Cloud Computing:** Facilitates data storage and processing, ensuring accessibility and scalability.
- **Mobile Application Framework:** Developed using React Native for a user-friendly interface on mobile devices.
- **IoT Integration:** Connects various sensors and devices for comprehensive health monitoring.
- **Data Encryption Protocols:** Ensures secure transmission of sensitive health information.
